# Numerical_Methods_Of_One-dimensional_Minimization_By_Derivative
Numerical methods of one-dimensional minimization using a derivative to solve problems of one-dimensional minimization by numerical methods.

## Task:
It is required to find the absolute minimum of a function of one variable y = f(x) on the segment [a, b], where the function is convex. That is, find a point x^* ∈ [a, b] such that f(x^*) = min f(x).
